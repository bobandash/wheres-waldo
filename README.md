## Live View:

## Technologies Used:
Front-End:
- React + Typescript
Backend:
- Express, Node.js
- MongoDB

## Quick Start
- 

## Concepts Learned
- More practice on common React hooks (first time using useRef and useContext)
- More practice on Backend CRUD operations 

## To-Do:
If I were to come back to this project in the future, I would want to:
- Refactor my react code to use custom hooks instead of storing them in one file
- Use useCallback when drilling down functions as props
- Filter out the pixel coordinates from front end, so that the user shouldn't be able to intercept the location of the waldos
